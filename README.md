The goal of idswb is to â€¦

## Installation

You can install the development version of idswb from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("Teal-Insights/idswb")
```

This package will likely never be published on
[CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) because the data file sizes are too
big.

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(idswb)
#> Loading required package: etl
#> Loading required package: dplyr
#> 
#> Attaching package: 'dplyr'
#> The following objects are masked from 'package:stats':
#> 
#>     filter, lag
#> The following objects are masked from 'package:base':
#> 
#>     intersect, setdiff, setequal, union
```
